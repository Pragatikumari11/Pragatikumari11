ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Pragatikumari11! I'm a 3rd-year engineering student with a keen interest in frontend development, machine learning (ML), and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. I have a solid understanding of DSA concepts, which I utilize to optimize algorithms and manage data structures effectively.

Currently, I'm learning various frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.js. I enjoy creating engaging user interfaces and interactive experiences for web applications.

In the realm of ML, I'm exploring algorithms, data preprocessing, and model building techniques. I leverage my knowledge of DSA and C++ to develop efficient solutions for ML projects, enhancing performance and scalability.

ðŸ’» I'm open to collaborating on projects that combine frontend development, ML, and DSA. Whether it's building web applications, implementing ML models, or optimizing algorithms, I'm eager to contribute and learn from others in the field.

ðŸ“« You can reach me via email at [pragatikumari01905@gmail.com] or connect with me on LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/in/pragati-kumari-0b7596262].

âš¡ Fun fact:While I may spend most of my time immersed in the world of technology, my true escape lies within the pages of poetry. There's something magical about the way words dance on the page, evoking emotions and painting vivid imagery in my mind. Whether it's losing myself in the timeless verses of classic poets or discovering new voices in modern poetry, reading poems is my cherished pastime. It's a retreat from the digital realm, allowing me to find solace and inspiration in the beauty of language and the depths of human expression. So, when I'm not debugging code or exploring new tech trends, you can often find me nestled with a book of poems, journeying through the landscapes of imagination and emotion. ðŸ“–âœ¨
